        <p>It was narrated from 'Aa'ishah that Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) entered upon her and there were two girls with her during the days of Mina beating the daff, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was covering himself with his garment. Abu Bakr rebuked them, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) uncovered his face and said, ‚ÄúLeave them alone, O Abu Bakr, for these are the days of Eid.‚Äù That was during the days of Mina.<br>All musical instruments are haraam but there are some ahaadeeth which indicate that only daff is permissible to beat in some circumstances such as Eid, weddings.</p>
